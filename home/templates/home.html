  I graduated from the University of California, Berkeley, with a B.A. in
  Molecular and Cell Biology. I'm a software developer working on the research
  team at 23andMe, a direct-to-consumer genetics testing company.
  <br><br>
  I unexpectedly discovered a love for programming while working as a clinical
  consultant at Triage Consulting Group. There, I researched and appealed
  complex clinical insurance denials. Many of my responsibilities involved writing
  SQL queries, transferring data between MS Access databases, exporting data to Excel, and
  generating reports. I knew there had to be a way to automate such repetitive
  processes, so I started googling. I learned some VBA, discovered stack overflow,
  and learned the utility of a for-loop.
  <br><br>
  In June 2017, I joined 23andMe as a Research Associate on the Research Program
  Management team. I interfaced with stakeholders in Engineering, Product,
  Marketing, and Finance; streamlined processes; developed training plans;
  supported program managers in assessing project and product feasibility. Among
  other things, I learned how to keep up in a fast-paced environment, and, most
  importantly, software's ability to impact so many aspects of our lives.
  <br><br>
  A few months after joining 23andMe, I took my first Python class, took on
  engineering responsibilities at work, got promoted, participated in (and won!)
  a hackathon, and built this website. When I'm not working or reading, I like
  to make pottery, learn languages,  cook, travel, and spend time with friends
  and family.
